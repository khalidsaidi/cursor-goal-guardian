  "goal": "Build an anti-goal-drift workflow for Cursor using an MCP goal authority and enforced permits.",
  "success_criteria": [
    "MCP server exposes tools: guardian_get_contract, guardian_initialize_contract, guardian_check_step, guardian_issue_permit, guardian_commit_result",
    "Cursor hooks block shell and MCP calls without a valid permit token",
    "Permits are short-lived and stored in .ai (gitignored) and cannot be read by the model",
    "Clear README + example configs (.cursor/mcp.json and .cursor/hooks.json) are provided"
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "No silent scope expansion: every step must map to explicit success criteria IDs.",
    "Prefer deterministic enforcement via hooks over prompt-only guidance.",
    "Never log to stdout inside the MCP server except JSON-RPC."
