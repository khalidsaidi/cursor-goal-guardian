  "goal": "Build an anti-goal-drift workflow for Cursor using an MCP goal authority and advisory permits.",
  "success_criteria": [
    "MCP server exposes tools: guardian_get_contract, guardian_initialize_contract, guardian_check_step, guardian_issue_permit, guardian_commit_result",
    "Cursor hooks warn on shell and MCP actions, with permit recommendations for unaligned or high-risk actions",
    "Permits are short-lived and stored in .ai (gitignored) and cannot be read by the model",
    "Clear README + example configs (.cursor/mcp.json and .cursor/hooks.json) are provided"
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "No silent scope expansion: every step must map to explicit success criteria IDs.",
    "Prefer deterministic guidance via hooks over prompt-only guidance.",
    "Never log to stdout inside the MCP server except JSON-RPC."
